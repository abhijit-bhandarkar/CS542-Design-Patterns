Assuming you are in the directory containing this README:

## To clean:
ant -buildfile src/build.xml clean

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To compile: 
ant -buildfile src/build.xml all

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To run by specifying arguments from command line 
## We will use this to run your code
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0="Input File" 
                                 -Darg1="Output File" 
                                 -Darg2="NUM_THREADS"
                                 -Darg3="Delete Words" 
                                 -Darg4="Debug Level"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## To create tarball for submission
ant -buildfile src/build.xml tarzip or tar -zcvf firstName_secondName_assign_number.tar.gz firstName_secondName_assign_number

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

Data Structures used in the implementationz:

Working instructions: 

  
  Use ant with proper debug level as an arg: 
  
    - 0: No output should be printed from the application to stdout. 
         However, it doesn't affect what's get written to the output file.
    - 1: Execution level logger.
    - 2: Printing the results only.
    - 3: Print to stdout everytime a thread's run() method is called
    - 4: Print to stdout everytime a constructor is called

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Extra Comments: 

Data structure used to build a tree of words is Binary Search Tree :

  A BST is implemented and the words are stored as nodes of the tree
  - Tried implementing the TRIE algorithm but the 
    main challenge was how to retrieve the character count 
    as the TRIE stores the words as a traversal of nodes, but
    when a word containing substring is marked leaf, it is 
    pretty difficult to retrieve the final word count
    starting with the root nodes. So, reverted back to BST.
    
  - Avg case time complexity to insert a single word is O(log(n)).
    Worst case time complexity to insert a single word is O(n).
    Best case time complexity to insert a single word is 1.
    
  - Avg case time complexity to delete a single word is O(log(n)).
    Worst case time complexity to delete a single word is O(n)
    Best case time complexity to delete a single word is 1.
    
  - Ant would need full file paths to provide the proper results.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide list of citations (urls, etc.) from where you have taken code
(if any).

- StackOverflow for errors and thread synchronization issues
- Referred the integers BST builder algorithm from the web and implemented the
  algorithm to incorporate strings in it with nodes storing the repetitions count.
